# Context Encoder for inpainting
## Implementation of "Context Encoders: Feature Learning by Inpainting" [[PDF](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pathak/papers/cvpr16.pdf)]

This TensorFlow (0.12) implementation of Context Encoder could support multi resolutions, for the image or the inpaint area. Additionally, it supports TensorBoard visualization.

This project is an extension of the fine TensorFlow implementation of Context Encoder by [T. Kim](https://github.com/jazzsaxmafia/Inpainting). 

## Instruction

To use the Context Encoder immediately, simply put the training data inside the data/default folder. Results will be shown at the results/default folder. To use Tensorboard, go to the root directory, start TensorBoard with logdir as logs.
